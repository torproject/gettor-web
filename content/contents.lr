title: What is GetTor?
---
body:

GetTor is a service that provides alternative methods to download the Tor Browser, especially for people living in places with high levels of censorship, where access to Tor Project's website is restricted.


# How does it work?

The idea behind GetTor is very simple:

- Step 1: Send a request to GetTor (gettor@torproject.org) specifying your operating system (and your locale). Ex: "windows es"

- Step 2: GetTor will send you back a reply with links to download Tor Browser from our supported providers.

- Step 3: Download Tor Browser from one of the providers. When done, check the integrity of the downloaded files by verifying its signature.

- Step 4: If required, get some bridges!

## How to verify a digital signature

Digital signature is a process ensuring that a certain package was generated by its developers and has not been tampered with.

In GetTor emails we provide a link to a file with the same name as the package and the extension ".asc". These .asc files are OpenPGP signatures.
They allow you to verify the file you've downloaded is exactly the one that we intended you to get.
For example, `torbrowser-install-win64-8.5.4_en-US.exe` is accompanied by `torbrowser-install-win64-8.5.4_en-US.exe.asc`.

## How to get bridges

Bridge relays are Tor relays that are not listed in the public Tor directory.
That means that ISPs or governments trying to block access to the Tor network can't simply block all bridges.
Bridges are useful for Tor users under oppressive regimes, and for people who want an extra layer of security because they're worried somebody will recognize that they are contacting a public Tor relay IP address.

When you start TorBrowser for the first time you will be asked if you want to use bridges. To use pluggable transports, click 'Configure' in the Tor Launcher window that appears when you first run Tor Browser.

You can also configure pluggable transports while Tor Browser is running by selecting 'Preferences' from the settings menu to the right of the address bar. Once in Preferences, navigate to 'Tor Settings' from the menu on the left of the screen.

Select 'Tor is censored in my country,' then click 'Select a built-in bridge.' Click on the drop-down menu and select the pluggable transport you'd like to use.

Click 'OK' to save your settings.

If built-in bridges do not work, you can also select 'Request a bridge from torproject.org'. This will require you solve a CAPTCHA and will automatically populate your settings with one or more bridges.

Another way to get bridges is to send an email to bridges@torproject.org. Please note that you must send the email using an address from one of the following email providers: Riseup or Gmail.
